#  _Go Food Yourself_
## _Overview_
For this project we created a web app that allows the user to choose ingredients form a categorized list of Items that they have handy, and generate a recipe made with the chosen ingredients. There is also an admin mode that will allow you to add ingredients and recipes if you find that necessary. This app was created using Sequalize, MySQL, jQuery, Node, and Waypoint. It follws an MVC design pattern, and is deployed to Heroku.
## _Running the Application_

The api page if you would like to use the content for your webapp is found [here](https://go-food-yourself.herokuapp.com/api/recipe).<br/>

## _Walkthrough_
[Here]() is a walkthrough of the application and an example from each of the views.

## _Future Development and Features_
The main goals we have for the future development of this app are as follows
1. Formatting the list so that the recipes closest to having all of the selected ingredients is first and the one with the least is last.
1. Adding a search form on the ingredients to aid in the selection process.
1. Adding dietary restrictions or cuisine preferences e.g. Vegitarian, Mexican, Italian, Gluten Free
1. Generating a shopping list from a recipe that you like but might not have the majority of ingredients for.
1. Allowing for a link to a delivery service that will be filled with the missing ingredients from youyour chosen recipes.
1. User authentication so that you can login and save favorite recipes for later.
